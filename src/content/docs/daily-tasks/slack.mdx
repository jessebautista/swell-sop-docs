Slack is our primary tool for internal communication. Here are your daily tasks related to Slack:

1. **Check Important Channels**
   - Log into Slack and review messages in important channels since your last shift. These typically include:
     - #general for company-wide announcements
     - #support for customer support issues
     - #user-questions for automated notifications about new user questions
   - Respond to any messages or threads where your input is needed.

2. **Review Direct Messages**
   - Check your direct messages for any questions or requests from team members.
   - Respond to these messages promptly.

3. **Check for @mentions**
   - Review any messages where you've been @mentioned.
   - Respond to these mentions or take any necessary actions.

4. **Monitor Relevant Channels**
   - Keep an eye on channels relevant to your role throughout your shift.
   - Contribute to discussions where appropriate.

5. **Update Your Status**
   - Set your Slack status to reflect your availability (e.g., "In a meeting", "On lunch", etc.).
   - Remember to update this throughout your shift as your status changes.

6. **Check for Important Updates**
   - Look for any important updates or announcements that may have been posted.
   - These could include system status updates, policy changes, or other critical information.

7. **Collaborate on Ongoing Issues**
   - Use Slack to collaborate with team members on any ongoing issues or projects.
   - Start threads to keep conversations organized and easy to follow.

8. **Share Relevant Information**
   - If you come across information that would be useful to your team, share it in the appropriate Slack channel.

Remember to maintain a professional and respectful tone in all your Slack communications. While Slack can be more casual than email, it's still a work communication tool.
