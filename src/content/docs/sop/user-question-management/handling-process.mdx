## Question Triage

1. Questions are initially triaged based on the account level of the user who submitted them.
2. Enterprise-level account questions are prioritized and assigned to the dedicated team of engineers.
3. Standard or community-level account questions are currently not assigned to specific team members for review.

## Answering Questions

### Enterprise-Level Accounts

1. The assigned engineer reviews the question and gathers necessary information.
2. If needed, the engineer may consult with other team members or departments.
3. Once a solution or answer is determined, the engineer responds directly to the user through the appropriate channel.
4. The question is marked as resolved in the Asana project.

### Standard or Community-Level Accounts

1. These questions are posted to the dedicated Slack channel.
2. Any team member with the knowledge to answer can respond to the question.
3. If a team member answers a question, they should update the corresponding task in the Asana project.

## Follow-Up

1. For enterprise-level accounts, the assigned engineer is responsible for any necessary follow-up.
2. For other account levels, follow-up is currently on an ad-hoc basis, depending on team member availability and expertise.

Remember, our processes may evolve over time, especially regarding the handling of questions from standard and community-level accounts.
