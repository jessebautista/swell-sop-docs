description: How users submit questions and how they are initially processed

This document outlines the process for submitting and initially processing user questions.

## User Question Submission Form

We use a dedicated Asana form for user question submissions. This form should be used for all questions received from users that support or other departments are unable to answer on their own.

## Initial Processing

1. When a question is submitted, it is automatically added to our Asana project for user questions.
2. For non-enterprise level accounts, an automated notification is posted to our dedicated Slack channel.
3. Enterprise-level account questions are handled separately and are not posted to the Slack channel.

## Slack Channel for User Questions

We have a dedicated Slack channel for automated reporting of user questions:

- Only questions received from non-enterprise level accounts are posted here.
- Team members are encouraged to respond to any questions they can answer.

Remember, there are currently no team members assigned to review or answer questions from standard or community level accounts. However, we have a team of engineers dedicated to responding to questions from enterprise-level accounts.
