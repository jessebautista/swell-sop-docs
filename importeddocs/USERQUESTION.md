# User questions

[User questions submission form](https://form.asana.com/?k=fDPGL72ImZRT8haQt0Mwdg&d=1126683767705082)

- This should be used for all questions received from users for which support or other departments are not able to answer on their end. These questions tend to be technical in nature and require an engineer or PM to advise in most cases.
- Please note that there are no team members assigned to review or answer questions received from standard or community level accounts at this time. We do have a team of engineers working to respond to any questions for enterprise level accounts. This might be extended to questions received from other levels of accounts in the future.

- Only questions received from non-enterprise level accounts will be posted here as enterprise level questions are being handled differently.
- We welcome anyone from the team to respond and answer any questions posted here that they can.
