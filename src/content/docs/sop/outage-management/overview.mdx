To effectively deal with an outage, it is crucial to follow a set of steps:

1. **Monitor the Outage**: Upon receiving the issue either internally or from a user, begin by monitoring the outage using the status.swell.store platform. This tool provides real-time updates and valuable information about the status of the system. By staying informed, you can better understand the scope and impact of the outage.

2. **Report the Incident**: If an outage is confirmed (dashboard inaccessible, status page showing irregular status, or when testing), promptly report the incident to the appropriate channels. In this case, it is recommended to report the incident to the #infrastructure channel on Slack. This channel is specifically designated for infrastructure-related issues and ensures the incident reaches the relevant team members.

3. **Tag the Infrastructure Team**: When reporting the incident on Slack, make sure to tag the infrastructure team. At the time of writing, the infrastructure team consists of Dima, Man, and Matt. By tagging them, you ensure that the right individuals are alerted to the issue and can take immediate action. Pagerduty usually does this first, but if not, still tag the infrastructure team.

4. **In case no infrastructure team is available:** If no member from the Infra team answers in (15) minutes, escalate the matter to the head of support, Steven Knobles.

Remember, effective communication is key during an outage. Be sure to provide all the details about the incident, such as the specific symptoms, error messages, and any relevant logs. This information will help the infrastructure team diagnose and resolve the issue more efficiently, leading to a prompt resolution.

By following these steps and communicating effectively, you can contribute to a smoother outage management process and minimize the impact on users and systems.
