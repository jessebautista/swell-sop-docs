This section provides a comprehensive guide to managing bug tickets in our system. We use Asana as our primary tool for tracking and managing bug reports. The process involves several stages, from initial submission to resolution and follow-up.

1. **Project Fields**: We use various fields in Asana to categorize and prioritize bug tickets. These fields help us track the status, priority, and other important aspects of each bug.

2. **Handling Process**: Depending on the priority of the bug, we follow different procedures to ensure timely resolution.

3. **Manual Follow-Up**: We have a structured process for following up with users about their reported bugs, ensuring that no customer is forgotten.

4. **Updating and Closing Issues**: There are specific procedures for updating bug tickets and closing them once resolved.
