1. **Project Fields**: We use various fields in Asana to categorize and prioritize bug tickets. These fields help us track the status, priority, and other important aspects of each bug.

2. **Handling Process**: Depending on the priority of the bug, we follow different procedures to ensure timely resolution.

3. **Manual Follow-Up**: We have a structured process for following up with users about their reported bugs, ensuring that no customer is forgotten.

4. **Updating and Closing Issues**: There are specific procedures for updating bug tickets and closing them once resolved.
