This document outlines how we use Asana to manage and track user questions.

## Asana Project Overview

We use an Asana project to keep track of all open user questions. This project helps us organize, prioritize, and manage the questions efficiently.

## Project Structure

1. Each user question is represented as a task in the Asana project.
2. Tasks are automatically created when a user submits a question through the submission form.
3. The project is set up as a list view for easy scanning and management.

## Task Management

1. **New Questions**: When a new question is submitted, it appears at the top of the list.
2. **Assignment**: For enterprise-level accounts, questions are assigned to the appropriate engineer.
3. **Status Tracking**: Tasks can be marked with different statuses (e.g., New, In Progress, Waiting for Info, Resolved).
4. **Comments**: Team members can add comments to tasks for internal discussion or to log progress.
5. **Attachments**: Relevant files or screenshots can be attached to the task for reference.

## Reporting and Analytics

1. Asana's reporting features can be used to track metrics such as response times and resolution rates.
2. Regular reviews of the project can help identify common issues or areas for improvement in our product or documentation.

Remember to keep the Asana project up-to-date by regularly reviewing and updating the status of tasks. This ensures that we have an accurate overview of all open user questions at any given time.
