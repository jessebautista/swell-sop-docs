# Manual Follow Up (Because we don’t forget about our customers)

---

# Introduction

From a recent interview, we found out that one of our company’s weaknesses is the support. As an effort to increase our overall performance, we’ll be implementing a new process. The follow-ups - It’s the ultimate signifier that we don’t take our users for granted. Following up with users is a type of marketing and can be a valuable asset while growing our platform. 

In this document, we’ll be outlining the process for following up with our users. Whether it’s a question or bug, we’ll list it down step by step, process by process.

# Process

The process guide will be broken down into several categories:

- **Enterprise level accounts**
- **Standard level accounts**
- **Community level accounts**
- **Inactive users**

## Bugs

### Enterprise-level accounts:

- For bugs reported by Enterprise users, **regardless** of the severity of the issue, we must follow up **every five business days** to give them an update.
- In the Asana Bugs board, filter the bugs based on the Enterprise **account** and select **Choose Any.** From there, select all Enterprise accounts.

# Summary

This document outlines a process for following up with customers, depending on their account level, to ensure they are not taken for granted. It includes instructions for filtering bug reports based on the account level, sorting by last follow-up date, and referring to a guideline for follow-up emails.

The process begins by filtering the bug reports according to the customer's account level. This is a critical step, as customers with different account levels should be treated differently. This can be done manually by looking up the customer's account information in the database and sorting them accordingly.

Once the bug reports have been filtered, it is important to sort them by the date of the last follow-up. This will allow us to identify which customers have yet to be followed up with in the recent past. This is essential, as we do not want any customer to be taken for granted.

Finally, it is important to refer to the follow-up email guidelines to ensure the customer receives the appropriate response. This should include details such as addressing the customer's specific issue, offering helpful advice, and expressing gratitude for their patience. Furthermore, by utilizing the follow-up email guidelines, we can ensure that the customer has a positive experience. This is important, as customer satisfaction is key to long-term success.
