## Flow

### Initial Filing

1. Chat or Email comes to Intercom. Support team member must try their best to assist the user and find the answer using the resources mentioned above.
2. If the user's concern is a bug, replicate the bug first or ask for a screen recording. Screen recording is a must.
3. Use the submission form and fill in the details as accurately as possible. Once filed, add the details in the user notes section in Intercom. Close the conversation afterward.

## Initial Processing

1. When a question is submitted, it is automatically added to our Asana project for user questions.
2. For non-enterprise level accounts, an automated notification is posted to our dedicated Slack channel.
3. Enterprise-level account questions are handled separately and are not posted to the Slack channel.

## Slack Channel for User Questions

We have a dedicated Slack channel for automated reporting of user questions:

[User questions Slack channel](https://swellcorp.slack.com/archives/C03P64T8WKX)

- Only questions received from non-enterprise level accounts are posted here.
- Team members are encouraged to respond to any questions they can answer.

Remember, there are currently no team members assigned to review or answer questions from standard or community level accounts. However, we have a team of engineers dedicated to responding to questions from enterprise-level accounts.

## Question Triage

1. Questions are initially triaged based on the account level of the user who submitted them.
2. Enterprise-level account questions are prioritized and assigned to the dedicated team of engineers.
3. Standard or community-level account questions are currently not assigned to specific team members for review.

## Answering Questions

### Enterprise-Level Accounts

1. The assigned engineer reviews the question and gathers necessary information.
2. If needed, the engineer may consult with other team members or departments.
3. Once a solution or answer is determined, the engineer responds directly to the user through the appropriate channel.
4. The question is marked as resolved in the Asana project.

### Standard or Community-Level Accounts

1. These questions are posted to the dedicated Slack channel.
2. Any team member with the knowledge to answer can respond to the question.
3. If a team member answers a question, they should update the corresponding task in the Asana project.

## Follow-Up

1. Every few hours, check in the Asana board for user questions for any responded tickets. Make sure to relay the information provided by our team to the user as accurately as possible. If unsure, clarify with the assigned engineer and gather more information to avoid going back and forth with the users and our engineering team.

### Second and Third Follow-Up

1. Every other day, get back to users who already got notified. If you havenâ€™t heard back from them after 4 business days (2 days after the third follow-up), close the ticket. Make sure to remove the notes under user notes and add it in the conversation as a comment for tracking purposes.

1. For enterprise-level accounts, the assigned engineer is responsible for any necessary follow-up.
2. For other account levels, follow-up is currently on an ad-hoc basis, depending on team member availability and expertise.

Remember, our processes may evolve over time, especially regarding the handling of questions from standard and community-level accounts.
