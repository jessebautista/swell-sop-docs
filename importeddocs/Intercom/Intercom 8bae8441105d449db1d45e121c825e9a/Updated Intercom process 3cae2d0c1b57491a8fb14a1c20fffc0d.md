# Updated Intercom process

Change #1 - New inbox

---

I changed a few things in our inbox so that we can track things a little better and so that Intercom will start generating some additional analytics I need.

I removed the 'Support Questions' team. This was the inbox set up to counter the sales bot that they implemented a few months back so that we could separate our conversations from theirs, but now that they are not using this, for the time being, we no longer need it.

All new conversations will be assigned to the 'Swell Support' team inbox. Everyone needs to be monitoring this inbox for new conversations.

Once you reply to a new conversation, you will automatically be assigned to the conversation by the system. The conversation will then be removed from the 'Swell Support' inbox and placed within your personal inbox, which is usually labeled as 'You'. Once the conversation is assigned to it, you are responsible for it during that time frame.

If you need someone else from our team to advise on the conversation, you need to make sure that you ping (@) that person in the details.

Change #2 - User tags

---

I have added a new data section on the right-hand side of the conversation window. This new data section has been added for analytical purposes.

For all conversations, this section needs to be checked, and if no tag is present, a tag needs to be added that represents the user account's highest level of plan.

For example, we have users who message in that are connected to multiple accounts of various plan levels. Enterprise, Standard, Community, Trial.

Whichever is the highest that the user is connected to, add the tag for that level of the plan.

Once the appropriate level of tag is added the Intercom system will tag each conversation according to the user's level of plan. This will be creating analytics for us to understand what level of plans are utilizing support most.

Change #3 - Away mode ðŸš¨ðŸš¨This is very importantðŸš¨ðŸš¨

---

Moving forward, we need to be placing our individual Intercom accounts on â€˜Away Modeâ€™ when we are not actively covering chat.

To enable the away mode, select your profile at the bottom left of the app. Enable the â€˜Set as awayâ€™ setting. When doing so, you will be given another option to enable â€˜Reassign repliesâ€™. This needs to be enabled as well.

![Away 1.png](Updated%20Intercom%20process%203cae2d0c1b57491a8fb14a1c20fffc0d/Away_1.png)

![Away 2.png](Updated%20Intercom%20process%203cae2d0c1b57491a8fb14a1c20fffc0d/Away_2.png)

What this is doing is indicating to the Intercom system that you are not available to respond to conversations and that if a user messages in on a conversation you are assigned to, to reassign the conversation back to the â€˜Swell Supportâ€™ inbox to be picked up by one of the support team members who are actively covering chat.

This process will help to track things better for analytics. More insight on who is handling what and how quickly they are handling it. Additionally, with the new inbox change this will ensure that if users message in on a conversation you are assigned to, their message will not be ignored until your next shift and will divert it to the main inbox for all to see.
