description: An overview of the user request management process

This section provides an overview of how we handle user requests at our company. User requests are an important part of our product development process, allowing us to gather feedback, improve our product, and meet user needs.

## What are User Requests?

User requests are feature suggestions or enhancement requests submitted by our users through various channels. These requests help us understand what our users need and want from our product.

## Key Components
