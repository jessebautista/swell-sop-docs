# Asana bug handling process

Once an issue has been submitted to Asana, it will be handled differently depending on the priority of the issue.

**Critical issues**:

- Critical issues are of the highest priority and are to be reviewed and assigned to be worked on as soon as possible.
- Special Slack channels could potentially be opened for this level of issue in order to triage and resolve the issue as quickly as possible - These are not created by support.

**Urgent issues**:

- These issues will be reviewed and assigned by product and engineering after all critical level issues have gone through the process.

**High issues**:

- These issues will be discussed within a weekly bug triage meeting that we have with various heads of product, engineering, and infrastructure.
- After discussion, the issues will be assigned to a product manager and added to their Asana project to be picked up.
- Keep in mind that issues with this priority level will be worked on after critical and urgent issues.

**Med/Low issues**:

- These issues are placed within a backlog to be reviewed and picked up once higher-level issues have been resolved.
- Issues set to this level of priority have no guarantee to be reviewed or fixed within a certain time frame.
- Support team members: If an issue that is set to either medium or low priority needs to be considered to be upgraded to a higher priority, please reach out to a support manager to discuss.

### Progress of issues

- As issues are worked on, the way we can gain insight into the progress is by reviewing the various product fields, engineering fields, and the comment section.
- As outlined within the [Project fields explanations](Project%20fields%20explanations%20feda69273a074e52add06f5af921818c.md) page, the fields to track for updates on the progress are the ‘[Product stage](https://www.notion.so/Custom-fields-a8f6fcac0bd44bd0aef8d36d3b6f69c7?pvs=21)’ field, ‘[Status](Project%20fields%20explanations%20feda69273a074e52add06f5af921818c.md)’ field, ‘[Resolution state](Project%20fields%20explanations%20feda69273a074e52add06f5af921818c.md)’ field, and ‘[Activity log/comment](Project%20fields%20explanations%20feda69273a074e52add06f5af921818c.md)’ section.
- These fields will be updated by product and engineering as the issue progresses. Additional comments will be made in the comment section by the corresponding PM and/or engineer.
- If there is a particular issue that you would like to follow and receive notifications of any change in the process, you can join the task via the button at the bottom of the task page.

### Requesting updates

- Before requesting an update, **please review the status** of the fields and the activity/comments section to understand where the issue is in the process.

When not to request an update:

- If an issue is not assigned to anyone, do not request an update on the issue. The issue is in queue to be picked up and will have someone assigned to it when availability opens.
    - If you feel that an unassigned issue needs to be looked into before it has been assigned, please reach out to your support manager.
- If the activity feed or comment section has been updated within the past 7 days
    - If there are no specific updates directed towards the user, we then notify the user that the issue is picked up and is actively being worked on.

When to request an update:

- If the activity feed or comment section has not been updated within the past 7 days
- If an enterprise user messages in requesting an update or an ETA for the resolution, follow the rule above regarding the activity/comment feed, unless the message from the user sounds pressing, then speak with your support manager to determine if requesting an update would be appropriate.

How to request an update:

- Within the comment section of the issue, @ the team member assigned to the issue. This will usually be an engineer or a product manager.
- The engineer or product manager will be assigned to the issue, but in the case that no one is assigned and an update is needed, the list of product managers and their departments below will help to determine who to direct the message to.

### Updating issues on supports end

Reasons for updating an issue in Asana:

- 1: To provide additional details received from a user
    - If we received additional details on the reported issue, either by the user providing them or by request on our end, these additional details should be added to the comment section.
    
- 2: To update the issue indicating that the user has been notified
    - When a fix has been deployed, either confirmed by a PM/engineer or updated via the status field, we will notify the user(s) who reported the issue. After they have been notified, the ‘User notified’ field should be updated to ‘Yes’
    - There is another option for the ‘User notified’ field to indicate that the issue was internal.

- 3. To close an issue
    - Once the issue has been confirmed as completed, we will need to close the issue within Asana.
    - This entails updating the bugs project section and moving the issue to the ‘Closed’ section and then marking the issue as complete.
    - Example:
