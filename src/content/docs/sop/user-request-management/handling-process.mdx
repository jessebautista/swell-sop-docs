This document outlines the process for handling user requests once they have been submitted and added to our Asana project.

## Request Evaluation

1. The product team reviews new requests on a regular basis (typically weekly).
2. Each request is evaluated based on several factors:
   - Alignment with product strategy
   - Potential impact on user experience
   - Technical feasibility
   - Resource requirements

## Prioritization

1. Requests that pass the initial evaluation are prioritized.
2. Prioritization factors include:
   - Number of users who would benefit
   - Strategic importance
   - Effort required vs. potential impact
   - Urgency of the need

## Implementation Decision

1. High-priority requests are discussed in product planning meetings.
2. A decision is made to:
   - Approve for implementation
   - Keep for future consideration
   - Decline

## Implementation Process

For approved requests:

1. The request is added to the product roadmap.
2. It's assigned to a development sprint or project.
3. The product manager creates detailed specifications.
4. The development team implements the feature.
5. QA tests the new feature.
6. The feature is released.

## User Communication

1. Users who submitted requests are kept informed of the status:
   - When the request is initially reviewed
   - If the request is approved for implementation
   - When the feature is released

2. For declined requests, a clear explanation is provided to the user.

Remember to update the Asana task at each stage of this process to maintain clear tracking and communication.
