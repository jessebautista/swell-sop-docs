# Best Practices

As Intercom is a powerful customer communications platform, it is important to follow best practices when using it. It is essential to create a customer experience that is tailored to their behavior, with targeted messages, and with conversational support. By following the best practices outlined in this guide, we can ensure that our interactions with customers are meaningful and effective. In this guide, we will discuss the importance of setting up correct intercom statuses when logging in or out, handling conversations in the first hour, refraining from confirming specific dates, and keeping user notes clean.

- Always change to the correct intercom status when logging in or out.

Set as away and Reassign replies enabled upon logging out.

- Make sure to handle any conversation in the first hour it entered Intercom. If itâ€™s something that you think youâ€™ll be working on for more than an hour, ask for assistance.
- Never promise or confirm something without a reference. If a user is asking for a specific feature and youâ€™re not sure, consult your manager. Even with a specific release date, please refrain from advising the exact date and instead, advise the Quarter for allowance in case of a delay.
    - Good response: The Horizon theme is being planned to be released in Q3 of this year.
    - Bad response: The Horizon theme will be released by the end of this month.
- Keep user notes clean. Follow the format below when adding user notes. **Bugs are to be added individually, while User Requests should be grouped in one note.**

# Standard Operating Procedures

Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are essential in guaranteeing that customer service encounters are predictable, effective, and of superior quality. SOPs record the means required to play out a specific assignment or procedure related to customer service. They help our team to rapidly and proficiently tackle customer issues, lessening the odds of blunders and false impressions.

Moreover, SOPs strive to acquire productivity, quality results, and execution uniformity while diminishing miscommunication and non-compliance with industry standards. They enable our team to work with consistency, making sure each customer service interaction is carried out in the same manner. Additionally, SOPs can save time and money, as they provide a clear set of instructions for our team to follow when resolving customer issues. By following SOPs, our team is able to provide a higher quality service in less time, reducing customer wait times and improving customer satisfaction.

## New conversations

There are typically two main types of conversation: **Bug reports** or **Questions**. Listed below are some guidelines to follow when handling new conversations.

1. Once a new conversation showed up, quickly glance at the content of the conversation.
    - If the new conversation is spam, close the conversation and notify your team manager. The team manager will identify if the sender needs to be blocked from Intercom.
    - If the new conversation is an email, make sure to quickly draft an email response to the user.
    - If the new conversation is a chat from a user, respond right away. A simple greeting or acknowledgment will do while you or your team is trying to identify the issue or concern of the user.

2. For bug reports, always try to identify the issue of the user and collect every detail needed. Listed below are some of the most requested details from the user.
    1. **Link -** depending on the issue, this could be the store link, product link, order link, etc.
    2. **How-to instructions** - Always, always replicate the issue being reported by any user. If you canâ€™t replicate it, request additional information from the user on how to replicate the issue.
    3. **Specific information** - Specific card used, specific time of the transaction, screenshots, or details that canâ€™t be found in our platform (i.e Stripe transaction details found in Stripe dashboard that we donâ€™t have access to)
    4. **Video Recording or Screenshots** - Requesting recording or screenshots helps our engineer or our team replicate and identify the issue.
    
    For user questions, make sure that you understand and acquire the necessary information. Acquiring all details on the first interaction will help decrease the resolution time and will help our team provide a more accurate answer.
    
3. Log the question or the bug raised by the user.

## Following Up with users

There are several scenarios where you will be following up with a user.

1. **Going back to the user after checking resources ( less than an hour ).** This usually happens when you advise the user that youâ€™ll be back after checking resources on your end. It could be that you were trying to replicate an issue, checking our knowledge base of FAQs, or checking their account to observe the report. The possible course of action is as follows:
    1. The user asked a general question, and no tickets were created or moved. In this case, no further action is needed. Close the conversation once done.
    2. You found a related ticket regarding the userâ€™s concern. Add the user to the ticket after following up with the user. Once the ticket is updated, add the links to the user notes. Close the issue after notifying the user.
2. **Updating the user in response to engineersâ€™/product managersâ€™ requests.**

a. Gather necessary information from the engineers: Before reaching out to the user, gather any additional information or updates that the engineers have provided regarding the user's question or issue. This will ensure you have all the necessary information to provide a complete and accurate response to the user.
    
    b. Review the response from the engineer. Prepare a clear and concise message: Create a message that is clear, concise, and easy to understand. Clearly state that you have additional information regarding their question and highlight the most important details.
    
    c. Personalize the message: Whenever possible, personalize the message by addressing the user by name and mentioning their specific question or issue. This will make the message more personal and show users that their concerns are being taken seriously.
    
    d. **Document your follow-up**: Make sure to document your follow-up with the user in the user notes and the Asana ticket so that you can refer back to it later and ensure that the user's concerns have been addressed.
    
    ****
    
3. **Updating the user that their issue is now fixed.**

1. Confirm the resolution of the bug: Before reaching out to the user, verify with the relevant engineers or developers that the bug has been resolved. This will ensure that the user is provided with accurate information.
2. Prepare a clear and concise message: Create a message that is clear, concise, and easy to understand. Clearly state that the bug has been resolved and highlight the critical details of the resolution.
3. Encourage user feedback: Encourage the user to provide feedback on the resolution of the bug, whether positive or negative. This feedback will help to improve the product and services in the future.
4. Document your follow-up: Make sure to document your follow-up with the user in the Asana ticket (by adding a comment after following up with the user) and adding a comment in the conversation before removing the user notes so that you can refer back to it later and ensure that the user's concerns have been addressed.

## When not to answer technical questions

This guide will help our team handle technical questions in an efficient and effective manner. It is important to note that the main goal of this guide is to ensure that our non-enterprise users, mainly community and standard plan users, receive the help they need in a timely manner.

1. When a non-enterprise user asks a technical question regarding the implementation of a use case using our API, direct them to our GitHub discussion page.
2. When a user reports a potential bug and needs confirmation, file it in Asana as a user question.
3. If the technical question is technical or code-related and the user is a non-enterprise user, refer them to the GitHub discussion.
4. If the technical question is a repeat of a previously answered question, direct the user to the relevant public knowledge base or FAQ article. If the answer is not publicly available, provide the instruction or information to the user.
5. If the technical question is related to a third-party integration or application, first look for a reference. Provide the reference to the non-enterprise user, then let them know they can post the question in the GitHub discussion.

Outro:
By following this guide, our team will be able to handle technical questions in an efficient and effective manner. This will ensure that our non-enterprise users, mainly community and standard plan users, receive the help they need in a timely manner.
