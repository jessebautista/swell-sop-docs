Our bug ticket handling process is designed to ensure that all reported issues are addressed efficiently and effectively, with a focus on maintaining clear communication with users.

## Initial Steps

When a user contacts support regarding a potential bug, the first step is to file a question to confirm whether the issue is indeed a bug. This involves consulting with an engineer to verify the nature of the issue.

Once confirmed as a bug, the next step is to file a bug ticket using the designated form: [Asana Bug Ticket Form](https://form.asana.com/?k=zh54nFA9Blv9DGDoCVLVCg&d=1126683767705082).

After filing the bug ticket, it is crucial to notify the user that their reported issue has been confirmed as a bug. This communication should be clear and informative, providing assurance that the issue is being addressed.

Subsequently, remove the current user question notes and add them to the conversation as a comment. Replace the user question notes with the bug ticket notes, ensuring the updated Asana link is included.

For users who do not request updates, notify them only once the bug ticket is deployed. Refer to the manual follow-up documentation for more detailed guidance on this process.
