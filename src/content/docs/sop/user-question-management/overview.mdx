User questions are an important part of our customer support process, allowing us to address user concerns, improve our product, and maintain customer satisfaction.

## What are User Questions?

User questions are inquiries submitted by our users through various channels, typically when they need assistance that goes beyond what our standard support or other departments can provide. These questions are often technical in nature and may require input from engineers or product managers.

## Tools

- **Intercom**: This is where we interact with the user. In some cases, we can find the answer here as well.
- **Asana**: This is where we check for existing user question tickets, and this is where the submitted ticket can be found. In some cases, we also look for answers here from previous tickets.
- **Notion**: Support Question and Answer board is the most comprehensive database where we can mostly find the answer.
- **Slack**: There are some channels where engineers and other team members post their questions here, either for additional insight or when trying to get clarifications. Best to search here as well when assisting users with technical questions.

## Key Points

1. We have a dedicated submission form for user questions.
2. Questions from enterprise-level accounts are handled differently from standard or community-level accounts.
3. We use Slack for automated reporting of non-enterprise user questions.
4. An Asana project is used to track and manage open user questions.
