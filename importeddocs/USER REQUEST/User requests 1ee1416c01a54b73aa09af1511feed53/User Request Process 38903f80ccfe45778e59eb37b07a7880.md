# User Request Process

<aside>
üí° Our roadmap changes on a regular basis, so we want to be careful as to what features/improvements/integrations we advise users will be added to Swell.

- Unless we have direct confirmation from the product team that a feature is being worked on and will be added at some point, we should never confirm something will be added.
- We never provide a date for when a feature will become available.
- The best way to approach it is to indicate that the requested feature/improvement/integration can be added to our list of user-requested features to be discussed by our team or, if it already exists, let the user know we will add their details to the logged requests, and as updates on the requested item become available, they will be notified.

Users requesting an improvement, a new feature, or a new integration are handled differently depending on their request. All kinds of user requests have to be submitted using the [User request submission form](https://form.asana.com/?k=A409iddrMk-r0gUmlHNlMw&d=1126683767705082).

<aside>
üí° Following the form and filling out the required fields will make sure that the request is assigned to the correct department and provide the product team with the needed information to advise on the request.

**Improvements:**

- Improvements are user requests where the current functionality of our platform's feature doesn‚Äôt necessarily fit their requirements.
- A good example is [this](https://app.intercom.com/a/inbox/wd9d6e67/inbox/shared/all/conversation/109694800121812) conversation. Bookroo is requesting for our system to automatically charge a new card after replacing an old card with a recent failed attempt where the current functionality is we either charge the card manually or wait for the retry period.

**Feature request:**

- These are kinds of user requests where a user is looking for specific functionality. This is different from improvements where functionality is absent in our platform.
- An example would be [Video Content Storage](https://app.asana.com/0/1202413815320586/1202505572768511/f). At the time of writing, we currently don‚Äôt support embedded videos (we don‚Äôt save videos).

**Integration request:**

- Integration Requests are requests from users looking for a built-in integration for a specific platform.
- A rule of thumb for integration requests is if a request requires to be ‚Äúconnected‚Äù with a third-party platform, that‚Äôs an integration request.
- Popular integration requests are payment gateways and 3PLs.

### General guide

- Once an improvement request is received, gather as much information regarding the user‚Äôs use case.

<aside>
üí° Pro tip: If a user wants to change the current behavior of specific functionality in our platform, that‚Äôs usually an improvement.

- For feature requests, discuss with your team leader if a workaround is not available for the requested feature. Your team manager might advise filing a support question first to confirm with engineering if the feature is not possible and needs to be submitted. There will be cases where we don‚Äôt have a feature out of the box but can be implemented in some other way.

<aside>
üí° It is important to confirm with our team if a feature is not really available to be used by the user. Most of the time, a feature can be implemented via a custom model, custom field, or storefront customization.

</aside>

- If a user is requesting a platform integration, confirm the website link of the platform (if can‚Äôt be found, request the link from the user) to ensure that you and the user is on the same page.

- The details we usually ask (depending on the request): use case(Why they need it), how they are foreseeing the feature to work, how it will be used, and where the request will be located.

- Fill out the [User request submission form](https://form.asana.com/?k=A409iddrMk-r0gUmlHNlMw&d=1126683767705082).

### What to ask?

When a user requests a feature to be implemented to our platform, it is of paramount importance that we as a team take the time to gather as much information as possible in order to understand the user's use case. As such, we should ask the user a series of questions to gain a better understanding of the feature they are requesting. Here are some sample questions that can be used to ensure that our team has the necessary information to proceed with the implementation of the feature:

- What is the primary purpose of the feature?
- Could you give us a more detailed description of how the feature should work?
- How will the user be using the feature?
- What is the context in which the feature is intended to be used?
- Is there a specific page or place where the feature should appear?
- Are there any existing solutions that the user is aware of that our team can use for reference?
- Are there any additional details the user can provide that will help us further understand their request?
