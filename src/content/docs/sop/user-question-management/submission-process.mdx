title: User Question Submission Process
description: How users submit questions and how they are initially processed
---
This document outlines the process for submitting and initially processing user questions.

## Flow

### Initial Filing

1. Chat or Email comes to Intercom. Support team member must try their best to assist the user and find the answer using the resources mentioned above.
2. If the user's concern is a bug, replicate the bug first or ask for a screen recording. Screen recording is a must.
3. Use the submission form and fill in the details as accurately as possible. Once filed, add the details in the user notes section in Intercom. Close the conversation afterward.

## Initial Processing

1. When a question is submitted, it is automatically added to our Asana project for user questions.
2. For non-enterprise level accounts, an automated notification is posted to our dedicated Slack channel.
3. Enterprise-level account questions are handled separately and are not posted to the Slack channel.

## Slack Channel for User Questions

We have a dedicated Slack channel for automated reporting of user questions:

[User questions Slack channel](https://swellcorp.slack.com/archives/C03P64T8WKX)

- Only questions received from non-enterprise level accounts are posted here.
- Team members are encouraged to respond to any questions they can answer.

Remember, there are currently no team members assigned to review or answer questions from standard or community level accounts. However, we have a team of engineers dedicated to responding to questions from enterprise-level accounts.
