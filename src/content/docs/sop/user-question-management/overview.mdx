This section provides an overview of how we handle user questions at our company. User questions are an important part of our customer support process, allowing us to address user concerns, improve our product, and maintain customer satisfaction.

## What are User Questions?

User questions are inquiries submitted by our users through various channels, typically when they need assistance that goes beyond what our standard support or other departments can provide. These questions are often technical in nature and may require input from engineers or product managers.

## Key Points

1. We have a dedicated submission form for user questions.
2. Questions from enterprise-level accounts are handled differently from standard or community-level accounts.
3. We use Slack for automated reporting of non-enterprise user questions.
4. An Asana project is used to track and manage open user questions.
