A good rule of thumb to follow when handling customer queries, requests, bugs, and questions is to communicate with customers in a timely and professional manner. It is also important to identify when a conversation needs to be snoozed or closed, and communicate the expectations for their request. Finally, be sure to provide prompt and accurate responses and keep the customer informed of the status of their request. By following these guidelines, we can ensure the best possible customer experience.

## User request:

Once the request has been filed for improvement or feature requests, it's important to let them know that their request has been received and will go undergo discussion by the team. You can now close the conversation once you get back to the user and it is clear what the expectation is for their request. It is important to ensure that the user is aware that their request is being taken seriously and will receive due consideration. Before the end of the conversation, let the user know that their request has been acknowledged and that they do not need to follow up with the team. It is also important to reassure the user that their request is being given the appropriate attention and that their input is valuable to the team. This will help to create a positive experience for the user and build a strong relationship between the team and the user.

Snooze: Does not apply, close the ticket as soon as the request is filed.

## Bugs:

When a user reports a bug, it's important to take the time to confirm that the bug does indeed exist and then log it on the Bug board using our Asana form. To ensure the report is properly documented, it's important to provide as much detail as possible. Once the bug has been logged, the conversation can be closed with the user, but it's important to set proper expectations around the timeframe for resolution. It's important to be transparent and honest about when a resolution can be expected, so that the user knows when to check back in for an update. Logging the bug in the Bug board will ensure that this information is tracked and can be referred to at any time.

Snooze: When additional details are needed from the user, snooze the conversation until all the details needed are added to the ticket. Close the conversation once no additional information is required from the user. 

## Questions:

When a user has a question, it's important to file a user question ticket and set proper expectations for the user. Snooze the conversation for **30 days.** If the question leads to the discovery of a bug, the user should be notified, a bug ticket should be created, and the conversation can be closed. If the question is answered, get back to the user and notify the information provided by our team. Follow the *Bug follow-up* cadence below for the timeframe.

Snooze: Snooze the conversation until the question is answered and the user confirmed.

## Bug follow-up:

Once a bug fix has been released, the user should be notified through the connected conversation. It's a good practice to snooze the conversation for 48 hours (excluding weekends) to allow the user time to test the fix. If there is no follow-up from the user after 48 hours, the conversation can be closed. For enterprise users, it's important to continuously follow up with them and update them every 24 hours for five business days. If there is still no update from the enterprise user, the ticket can be closed.
