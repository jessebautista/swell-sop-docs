# Asana Project Management for User Requests

This document outlines how we use Asana to manage and track user requests.

## Asana Project Overview

We use an Asana project to keep track of all user requests. This project helps us organize, prioritize, and manage the requests efficiently.

## Project Structure

1. Each user request is represented as a task in the Asana project.
2. The project is set up as a board view with columns representing different stages of the request lifecycle.

## Task Management

1. **New Requests**: When a new request is submitted, it appears in the "New" column.
2. **Evaluation**: Requests move to the "Under Evaluation" column when being reviewed by the product team.
3. **Prioritization**: Evaluated requests move to either "High Priority", "Medium Priority", or "Low Priority" columns.
4. **Implementation**: Approved requests move to "In Development" when being worked on.
5. **Completion**: Implemented requests move to "Done" once released.

## Custom Fields

We use custom fields to track important information:

1. **Requester**: The user who submitted the request
2. **Impact**: Estimated number of users who would benefit
3. **Effort**: Estimated development effort required
4. **Strategic Value**: Alignment with product strategy (High/Medium/Low)

## Reporting and Analytics

1. Asana's reporting features can be used to track metrics such as implementation rates and time-to-completion.
2. Regular reviews of the project can help identify trends in user needs and inform product strategy.

Remember to keep the Asana project up-to-date by regularly reviewing and updating the status of tasks. This ensures that we have an accurate overview of all user requests at any given time.
