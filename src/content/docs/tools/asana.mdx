Asana is our primary tool for tracking tasks, managing projects, and organizing our work. This guide will help you understand how to use Asana effectively in our organization.

## Purpose of Asana

We use Asana for:

1. Tracking individual tasks and responsibilities
2. Managing complex projects
3. Organizing and prioritizing work across teams
4. Documenting progress and decisions

## Key Features

1. **Tasks**: Individual work items with assignees, due dates, and descriptions.
2. **Projects**: Collections of related tasks, often with specific goals or timelines.
3. **Sections**: Used to organize tasks within projects.
4. **Custom Fields**: Allow for additional categorization and data tracking.

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Tasks Updated**: Regularly update the status, comments, and due dates of your tasks.
2. **Use Descriptions Effectively**: Provide clear, detailed descriptions for tasks and projects.
3. **Assign Responsibly**: Ensure each task has a clear owner.
4. **Use Due Dates**: Set realistic due dates and respect those set by others.

## Important Projects

We have several key Asana projects for different aspects of our work:

1. **User Requests Project**: [User requests Asana project](https://app.asana.com/0/your-project-id/list)
   - Used to track and manage feature requests and enhancement suggestions from users.
   - Each user request is added as a task in this project.

2. **User Questions Project**: [User questions Asana project list](https://app.asana.com/0/1202302358229231/list)
   - Used to track open user questions.
   - Questions are automatically added when submitted through our form.

3. **Bug Tracking Project**: Used to manage and prioritize bug reports.

## User Request Management

As outlined in our User Request Management SOP:

1. New requests are added to the "New" column of the User Requests project.
2. Requests move through columns as they are evaluated, prioritized, and implemented.
3. Custom fields are used to track important information like requester, impact, effort, and strategic value.

## User Question Management

As per our User Question Management SOP:

1. Questions are automatically added to the User Questions project when submitted.
2. For enterprise-level accounts, questions are assigned to specific engineers.
3. Tasks can be marked with different statuses to track progress.

Remember, Asana is our source of truth for task and project status. Keep it up-to-date to ensure everyone has the most current information.
