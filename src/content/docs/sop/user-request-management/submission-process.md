# User Request Submission Process

This document outlines the process for submitting and initially processing user requests.

## User Request Submission

Users can submit requests through various channels:

1. In-app feedback form
2. Email to our support team
3. Direct communication with account managers (for enterprise clients)

## Initial Processing

1. When a request is received, it is reviewed by our support team or account managers.
2. If the request is deemed valid and not a duplicate, it is added to our Asana project for user requests.
3. The support team or account manager acknowledges receipt of the request to the user.

## Asana Project for User Requests

We use a dedicated Asana project to track and manage all user requests:

[User requests Asana project](https://app.asana.com/0/your-project-id/list)

- Each request is added as a task in this project.
- The task includes details about the request, the user who submitted it, and any relevant context.

Remember, it's important to capture as much detail as possible when adding a request to Asana, as this information will be crucial for evaluating and prioritizing the request later in the process.
