# Guide to Researching

When our team receives questions from users, we need to research multiple channels to find the answers they need. Here are some tips on how to do effective research:

## Step 1: Identify the channels to search

Before you start researching, check all the channels you need to search. This might include:

- Slack for previous conversations, guides and details on how to do certain things from previous team members.
- Old forums for how-to's or previously asked questions.
- The question and answer Notion page for previously asked questions, and how to‚Äôs.
- The Github discussion page for newer answers and guides

Make sure to prioritize which channels to search first. For example, if you think the question was already asked on Notion, check if the answer is already there. If not, check the Slack and Github channels.

## Step 2: Use effective search terms

When searching each channel, it's important to use effective search terms to find the information you need. Here are some tips:

- When searching, it's important to be specific and use keywords that are pertinent and relevant to the question you're trying to answer. Doing this will ensure that you're getting a direct and clear response that addresses the issue at hand. Additionally, it's helpful to think about the context of the question, as this can help you determine the most appropriate words to use in your query.

- Utilize ‚Äúfirst words‚Äù: Utilize "first words" when searching for answers, by using the first words of the sentence to look for relevant information. This will help you get the most accurate and specific results. For example, if you're searching for information on how to use a specific feature in a particular product, use the words "how to use [product feature]" in your search terms.

- Search in Intercom as a last resort: Intercom contains most of the information provided to the user in the past but due to the difficulty in searching information, searching in intercom should be the last thing to consider on your list. Below is a screenshot where a very specific query doesn‚Äôt generate the correct list of conversation.

Additionally, when using Slack, you can use the "from:[username]" operator to search for messages from a specific person. When using Github, you can use the "label:" operator to filter by labels assigned to issues.

If you're not getting the results you need, try using different search terms or refining your search criteria. You might also try asking colleagues for help or reaching out to the community for assistance.

## Step 3: Document your findings

As you find information, make sure to document your findings so you can easily reference them later. Make sure to message Jenny as she‚Äôs the one managing the support Q and A board.

When submitting documentations regarding your findings, make sure to include the source of the information, the date it was found, and any relevant notes or context. This will make it easier to share your findings with Jenny.

## Step 4: Review and organize your findings

Once you've finished your research, take some time to review and organize your findings before responding back to the user. This might include:

- Categorizing your findings by topic or channel
- Highlighting the most relevant information
- Summarizing your findings.

When summarizing your findings, make sure to include any insights or recommendations for future research. This will help you formulate your response to the user. Additionally, this will help the team make better decisions and improve the overall research process.

üí° If you‚Äôre unsure with your findings, it‚Äôs best to consult a senior team member to verify the information you‚Äôve gathered. Providing wrong information to a user is a negative experience.
